CS193X Final Project Milestone
=============================

Project Name: practiceTrack
Your Name: Jaiden Reddy
Your SUNetID: jaiden

Overview
--------
<TODO: Let us know how things are going. What have you explored, looked into, worked on, and tried so far? What do you have left to do? Are you running into any particular difficulties or blockers?>

Things are going well. I have worked on creating a practice class and a log class to make a semi-functional front-end for a practice tracker and log. There is no back-end yet. I haven't run into any particular difficulties, so things are going pretty well.

Project Changes
---------------
<TODO: If you have needed to change your project in any way, such as scope, features, etc., please let us know what you changed.>

I have not needed to make many changes except that I may not include a visualization part of the project. If I don't, I will make sure the project still meets the required guidelines.

Follow-up
---------
N/A

API
---

I will have multiple API endpoints. One will get a specific user's practice log, allowing the page to load a user's previous practice logs. One will post to a user's practice log (add a new practice). One will delete a specific practice from a user's practice log.

GET /users/practicelog
POST /users/practicelog (object with a single key practice and a practice object)
DELETE /users/practicelog (query string targeting a practice)

External libraries and code
---------------------------
Right now, I only plan to use Google authentication. Otherwise, I won't use external libraries or code.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------
I looked at some tracker websites, such as this mood tracking website: https://emoodtracker.com
for design inspiration. I also looked at previous assignments and used that code for reference.

Anything else?
-------------
Nope. I am doing well.
